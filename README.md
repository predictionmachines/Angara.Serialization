# Angara.Serialization

A library that facilitates serialization on both .NET and JavaScript platforms and communication between them.  
The library contains built-in serializers for a wide range of types and can easily be extended with serializers for user-defined types.
Serialization formats are pluggable. The shipped implementation is based on JSON.
